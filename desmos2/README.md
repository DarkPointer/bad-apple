# Desmos Implementation 2

Same idea as first Desmos implementation, but with the added optimisations of using OpenCV contours to conduct edge-detection and merging continuous intervals of formulas with the same equations but different domains with prefix sum array. No video for this implementation as it is visually the same to the first Desmos implementation.
